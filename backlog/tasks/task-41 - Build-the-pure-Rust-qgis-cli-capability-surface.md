## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Implement the standalone GIS CLI contract from doc-7 without adding a PyQGIS/PyQt dependency to the pure path. Start with version, capabilities, doctor, validation, project manifest inspection, tile planning, batch planning, structured errors, deterministic artifacts, and explicit native-backend gates.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 version, capabilities, and doctor report engine, transport, backend, limits, and unavailable native capabilities
- [ ] #2 validate, inspect, tiles plan, and batch plan expose deterministic machine-readable behavior with stable exit codes
- [ ] #3 Pure CLI tests run without QGIS, Python, Node, or WebEngine and preserve existing qgis-cli behavior
- [ ] #4 Native-only render/export/serve paths fail explicitly when the backend is unavailable and never silently substitute semantics
- [ ] #5 Filesystem policy, atomic artifacts, JSON stdout, stderr diagnostics, cancellation, and resource limits have contract tests
- [ ] #6 Implementation follows red-green-refactor slices and preserves existing public command flags and golden values

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
The qgis-cli binary this task builds is what TASK-58 ships through @archont561/qgis-node and qgis-py.

Approved discovery slice: version, capabilities and doctor; binary and engine discovery public seams. Pure doctor exits 0 with optional native backend explicitly unavailable. Preserve existing commands; remaining TASK-41 slices stay open.

Discovery slice implemented: version/capabilities/doctor share deterministic text/JSON reports; engine owns availability, protocol owns names, clap owns command names. Existing engine_info wire response, flags, and execution gates are unchanged. Pure doctor exits 0 for optional QGIS absence. Red tests observed for missing engine seam and each new command; focused pure suites pass, native discovery tests pass. cargo tree and ldd confirm the no-default-features binary has no QGIS/Qt/Python/Node/WebEngine dependency. AC2-AC6 remain open for later slices; full gate evidence follows.

Final discovery-slice evidence: pixi run gates exit 0 (8/8); CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true pixi run -- bun x turbo run test --env-mode=loose exit 0 (12/12). Rust 327 + 30 (was 323 + 30); SDK 490 passed/3 skipped/8 deselected, qt 3, qgis 5, qgis-py-dist 18, Bun 160, CTest 1 target. Separate native-feature discovery run: CLI 3 and engine 2 passed. Pure focused suites: 58 integration tests plus 1 doc test; clippy -D warnings passed. No push/PR; AC2-AC6 remain open.

Approved validation slice implemented at the binary and checked-tile domain seams: validate extent/crs/zoom/tile, normalized deterministic JSON, syntax-only CRS, exits 0/10/2; legacy execution errors keep exit 1. Tile::checked_bounds guards invalid indices before arithmetic without changing existing bounds behavior. Each new kind and the domain guard had an observed red test before implementation. AC2 remains open because inspect/tiles plan/batch plan are not implemented; AC3-AC6 remain open for the overall task. Final gate evidence follows.

Validation slice verified: focused pure CLI/render suites 86 integration tests plus 1 doc test; native-feature validation subprocess suite 11/11; clippy -D warnings passed. pixi run gates exit 0 (8/8); offline loose-environment turbo test exit 0 (12/12), Rust 340 + 30 (was 327 + 30), SDK 490 passed/3 skipped/8 deselected, qt 3, qgis 5, qgis-py-dist 18, Bun 160, CTest 1 target. Existing 4568-tile golden values and legacy error behavior remain covered. No new external dependencies; no push or PR. AC1 remains the only checked criterion; remaining validation types and inspect/planning/artifact/resource/cancellation contracts are still pending.

Owner approved metadata-only inspect slice: qgis-cli inspect <project> [--json], file_metadata scope with qgis_validation not_performed, no XML/ZIP parsing. Public seams: CLI argv/streams/status, legacy info and discovery, observable filesystem side effects. Exits 0/2/10/11/14 are scoped to inspect; regular files and symlinks to regular files accepted. Red-green slices first; task remains In Progress with AC1 only checked. No push or merge authorized.

Metadata-only inspect implemented at the approved subprocess seams. Reports supplied path, extension-derived format and byte size with inspection=file_metadata and qgis_validation=not_performed. No contents/backend/network/artifact work. Symlinks follow regular targets; directories/special files, unsupported extensions and non-UTF-8 paths are invalid input. JSON failures carry code/message on stdout plus stderr diagnostics; exits 0/2/10/11/14 are scoped to inspect. Legacy info JSON/text and exit 1 are pinned; discovery still derives commands from clap, with no new engine operation or dependency.

Observed red-to-green for the missing command, missing-input classification, invalid/non-file classification, filesystem errors, human report and non-UTF-8 serialization panic. Pure CLI/render: 107 integration tests + 1 doc test passed. Native-feature CLI: 49 tests passed (20 inspection, 15 legacy CLI, 3 discovery, 11 validation). Pure clippy -D warnings, source/boundary checks, pure dependency tree and ldd checks passed. Docs build passed (50 pages). Full offline/loose turbo suite passed 12/12 (4 cached): Rust 361 + 30, SDK 490 passed/3 skipped/8 deselected, qt 3, qgis 5, qgis-py-dist 18, Bun 160, CTest 1 target. Repository gate result follows. AC1 remains the only checked criterion; this does not complete inspect manifests or AC2-AC6.

Repository gate passed after the focused local commit: pixi run gates exit 0, 8/8 (4 cached), with formatting, workspace Clippy and conventional-message hooks passing. Final help/docs clarify that inspect never initializes QGIS, but a native-enabled binary still needs its shared libraries; pure use is --no-default-features. No further runtime behavior change. Full task remains In Progress with AC1 only checked; no push or merge.

Owner approved a deterministic tile-planning slice plus a reconciliation of the
three surfaces that report a plan. `qgis-cli plan tiles --bounds ... --zoom ...`
counts an XYZ pyramid from an extent alone: no project argument, no file opened,
no backend initialised, nothing written. This is what the legacy
`tiles <project> --dry-run` cannot do, because that command shares the renderer
and so calls `Project::open` before counting anything.

The reconciliation is the substantive part. The engine said `tile_count`, MCP
said `total_tiles`, and MCP's per-level `tiles` was a *count* where the engine's
top-level `tiles` is the *enumerated array* — one word carrying two meanings
across a single boundary. All three now emit `qgis_render::TilePlanReport`,
defined once. The engine's wire response is byte-identical: Python reads
`planned["tile_count"]`/`planned["levels"]`, and Node reads `_planned.bounds`
and `_planned.zooms` as objects, so changing it would have broken two shipped
clients and quietly done TASK-42's work. MCP's output did change — `total_tiles`
to `tile_count`, `levels[].tiles` to `levels[].tile_count`, and the string
echoes of bounds/zoom became the structured values — and MCP was the only
in-repo consumer of the old names.

`plan` reuses the exit-10 category `validate` already established rather than
adding its own, so malformed input means the same thing whichever pure command
refused it. Exits are 0 success, 2 usage, 10 unreadable bounds/zoom or an
unordered extent/zoom range. Legacy `tiles` flags, its "Would render" wording
and the 4568-tile golden are now pinned byte-exact rather than by substring.

Public seams: new `crates/qgis-cli/tests/plan_tiles.rs` (15 tests) covers
argv/streams/status at the process boundary with `PATH=""` and an empty
tempdir — no-project success, golden per-level rows, the shared JSON key set,
determinism, no filesystem writes, exit codes, and JSON failures that keep
stdout parseable. Its `json_is_the_engine_and_mcp_answer` test asserts the CLI
report equals both the engine's `plan_tiles` result and the MCP tool's report,
which is what stops a fourth spelling appearing. `qgis-render` gained two tests
pinning the report's values and key names; `qgis-mcp` gained one pinning its
serialised keys; `crates/qgis-cli/tests/discovery.rs` now asserts `plan` is in
the parser-derived command list and adds no engine operation.

Observed red before green for the missing `plan` command, the missing
`TilePlanReport`/`report()` seam, the missing engine key names, and MCP's old
field names. Verification: pure focused suites passed; `cargo nextest
--workspace --no-default-features` **380 across 60 binaries** (was 361/59) and
native-feature **31 across 7** (was 30/7); 0 failures. Clippy `-D warnings`
passed for both profiles. `pixi run gates` exit 0, **8/8** (4 cached).
`CARGO_NET_OFFLINE=true pixi run -- bun x turbo run test --env-mode=loose
--force` exit 0, **12/12, 0 cached**: Python 490 passed/3 skipped/8 deselected,
qt 3, qgis 5, qgis-py-dist 18, Bun 160, CTest 1 target — all unchanged. No
lockfile drift: `Cargo.lock`, `pixi.lock` and `bun.lock` are untouched, the new
`qgis-mcp` dev-dependency being a workspace member already in the graph.
`ldd` on the `--no-default-features` binary shows only libc/libm/libpthread/
libgcc_s, and `cargo tree` confirms `qgis-mcp` stays out of the shipped binary.

TASK-41 stays In Progress with AC1 the only checked criterion. AC2 needs
`batch plan` as well as the now-shipped `validate`/`inspect`/`tiles plan`. XML
and container manifests still need parser dependencies locked and vendored on a
network-capable runner; native execution gates, atomic artifacts and filesystem
policy, cancellation and resource limits remain open. Nothing pushed or merged.
