## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
## Current contract
Reconcile and enforce the hosted SDK boundary under D13 and accepted D15. The qgis-sdk distribution is pure Python, built with setuptools, with one typer CLI. Hosted plugin lifecycle, UI, Processing, tasks, feedback and QGIS object ownership stay with qgis_sdk/PyQGIS/PyQt. The base distribution has no required dependency on qgis-py or its native extension, and standalone qgis-py remains a separate product.

There is no Rust qgis-sdk crate, qgis_sdk._core, SDK acceleration adapter, or Rust scaffold/build surface to restore. Plugin authors who choose Rust manage their own library and build outside the SDK contract. Native qgis-py and Node addons retain their existing wire boundaries; SDK-owned QGIS/Qt objects must not cross into them as live objects or pointers.

## Scope and existing evidence
Audit the current manifests, imports, wheel contents, public exports and supported runtime tests against these boundaries; extend public-seam coverage only where missing. Inspection already finds setuptools and only typer/questionary runtime dependencies in py-packages/qgis-sdk/pyproject.toml, no Rust SDK crate, and retirement/import tests in tests/test_pure_python.py and tests/test_cli_task57.py. Those are evidence starting points, not blanket acceptance checks; record exact tests and remaining gaps before closing criteria.

Pure SDK tooling must remain usable without importing QGIS. Hosted features require QGIS explicitly and use its lifecycle/threading policy rather than silently creating a second standalone engine session. Optional SDK-side detection for an explicit hybrid workflow must not become a base installation/import requirement or an SDK-owned Rust acceleration implementation.

## Related work and non-goals
TASK-63 separately owns the reverse-direction qgis_py import of qgis_sdk and the still-open HAS_QGIS_SDK compatibility decision; do not make that decision here or duplicate its fix. TASK-42 owns shared FFI client contracts. Do not restore retired qgis_rs aliases, Rust tooling, or CLI launchers. This rewrite changes the task contract only, not package behavior.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 The qgis-sdk base distribution declares no qgis-py dependency and its ordinary imports/tooling do not require or unconditionally import qgis_py or its native extension. Manifest and fresh-process import tests pin this boundary; any explicit SDK-side hybrid detection remains optional.
- [ ] #2 Hosted UI, Processing, plugin lifecycle, tasks, feedback and QGIS object ownership remain in qgis_sdk/PyQGIS/PyQt under the existing host lifecycle and thread-affinity contract. Supported hosted behavior neither silently creates a standalone engine session nor substitutes a fallback when QGIS is required.
- [ ] #3 The documented product split is verified: pure SDK tooling runs without QGIS or standalone bindings, while the qgis-py distribution does not require qgis-sdk as an installation dependency. The reverse-direction import probe and HAS_QGIS_SDK policy remain explicitly assigned to TASK-63, not implicitly checked off here.
- [ ] #4 The SDK wheel and public surface remain pure Python under D15: setuptools packaging, one qgis-sdk Python CLI, no native SDK extension or Rust SDK crate, and no SDK-owned Rust acceleration/scaffold/build commands. Existing retirement and CLI tests are retained or extended, not replaced with vacuous checks for deleted artifacts alone.
- [ ] #5 No SDK-owned live QGIS/Qt objects, raw pointers or QVariant values are handed across qgis_py native or Node NAPI boundaries. Supported cross-language integration uses the shared serialized protocol, copied values, opaque IDs or artifact metadata; TASK-42 owns the underlying FFI contract tests, with relevant evidence linked here.
- [ ] #6 Current supported imports and plugin lifecycle behavior remain covered without restoring removed aliases. Focused pure SDK tests, applicable Qt/QGIS hosted gates with offscreen serialized execution, and boundary checks pass; each checked criterion cites actual evidence and any environmental blocker stays open.

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
Names updated for the 2026-10 rename: the Python distribution is qgis-py and the Node package is @archont561/qgis-node. The qgis-rs compatibility alias is removed by TASK-60.

2026-10-10 owner-approved rewrite under D15. Former AC1 assumed a Rust SDK graph; AC3 used retired standalone naming; AC4 required an SDK-owned optional Rust acceleration adapter; AC5 named the deleted SDK extension and old Python alias. Those obligations are superseded by the six replacement criteria above, not completed by this edit. Earlier notes/comments are retained as historical context and are not the current contract. Status and dependencies remain unchanged; no AC is checked. TASK-63 retains its separate public-attribute decision.

Evidence audit (2026-10-10, read-only; no source changed).

AC1 — proven. py-packages/qgis-sdk/pyproject.toml declares dependencies = ["typer>=0.27,<1", "questionary>=2.1,<3"] and no qgis-py. The only mention of qgis_py anywhere in the package is py-packages/qgis-sdk/tests/test_cli_task57.py:73, which blocks it. That test spawns a fresh subprocess setting qgis, qgis.core, qgis.gui, qgis.PyQt, qgis_py and qgis_sdk._core to None in sys.modules and still runs `new` and `package` to exit 0 (test_cli_task57.py:69-91), so both the manifest probe and the fresh-process import probe this criterion asks for already exist.

AC3 — proven in the direction this task owns: py-packages/qgis-py/pyproject.toml declares no qgis-sdk dependency. The reverse-direction probe and the HAS_QGIS_SDK policy are correctly left to TASK-63 and are deliberately not checked here.

AC4 — proven. Build backend is setuptools.build_meta with requires = ["setuptools>=77", "wheel"]; no maturin, no pyo3, no ext_modules. test_build_configuration_has_no_rust_toolchain asserts setuptools present and maturin/pyo3 absent; test_pure_python.py pins that qgis_sdk._core and qgis_sdk._fallback_cli are not importable and that HAS_RUST/RUST_VERSION are exposed nowhere including qgis_sdk.styles; test_cli_task57.py:55-56 asserts the typer app has no `rust` subcommand.

AC6 — gates measured at the 2026-10-10 baseline: pure 490 passed / 3 skipped / 8 deselected, qt 3 passed / 498 deselected, qgis 5 passed / 496 deselected. The four-layer selection policy lives in qgis_sdk.testing.gates and is itself covered by tests/test_layer_gates.py, which explicitly refuses to call an unreachable layer a pass.

AC2 — needs a decision, not more evidence. The gate design above satisfies the "never fake a green" half. The other half, "does not substitute a fallback when QGIS is required", collides with fallbacks documented as always available: src/qgis_sdk/__init__.py:117 (network manager, "always available (fallback without QGIS)") and :125 (task manager, same), plus bridge/qgis_api/network.py:29 ("Fallback urllib"), bridge/qgis_api/processing.py:45 ("Fallback: try direct processing"), bridge/qgis_api/layers.py:103, bridge/qgis_api/message.py:31 and bridge/qgis_api/settings.py:15. These read as test-harness simulation for the pure layer rather than production substitution, but nothing in the tree says so, and this criterion cannot be checked until that distinction is written down. Resolve it as a clarification before implementing AC2; do not encode either reading into an acceptance criterion.

AC5 — delegated by its own text to TASK-42, which owns the FFI contract tests; the evidence to link is recorded in TASK-42's notes.

One defect found while auditing AC4, with no other owner: two comments still claim a Rust fast-path that D15 retired and that test_pure_python.py actively forbids — src/qgis_sdk/__init__.py:36 ("Styles IR — pure Python fallback, Rust when available") and src/qgis_sdk/styles.py:3 ("uses Rust when available"). styles.py contains no Rust reference at all. Documentation only, but it asserts a code path the tests prohibit.

2026-10-04: dropped the TASK-36 dependency. TASK-43 is a dependency-boundary task under D13 - qgis_sdk never depends on qgis-py, and qgis_sdk._core stays optional tooling - while TASK-36 defines the declarative UI contract. The two are orthogonal: nothing in TASK-43 reads or changes the UI surface. The edge was blocking TASK-43, and TASK-44 behind it, on a task neither needs. TASK-40, which defines the product boundaries this task enforces, remains the real prerequisite and is Done.
